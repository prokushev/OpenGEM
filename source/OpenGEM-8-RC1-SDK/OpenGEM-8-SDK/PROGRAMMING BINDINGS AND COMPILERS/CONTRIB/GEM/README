GEM bindings for DJGPP, v1.0.2                       John Elliott, 5 Oct 2002.
==============================================================================
  This is based on (and includes) the GEM Programmers' Toolkit, version 3.0.

  Detailed documentation is in DOC\DJGPP.TXT.

  The following directories are present:

* BIN      - The sample applications, as compiled with DJGPP.
* DOC      - The DOC directory from the GEM PTK, plus DJGPP-specific 
	    documentation.
* INCLUDE  - The headers used when compiling with DJGPP.
* LIB      - The bindings as a DJGPP library.
* SAMPLE   - The SAMPLE directory from the GEM PTK. This contains the 
            original 16-bit source code for the library and sample
            applications.
* SRC      - The 32-bit source code for the library and sample applications.
* TOOLS    - The TOOLS directory from the GEM PTK. This contains 16-bit
            binaries of the sample applications, and the Resource Editor
            (RCS.APP).


  To build, use "make".
  To copy the library and header files to your main DJGPP directory, use 
"make install".
