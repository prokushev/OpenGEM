INTRODUCTION
============

Thanks for download the latest version of FreeGEM Output. Please see below
for updates in this version.

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
===================

This version of Output requires FreeGEM or GEM/3. It will not work with GEM/2
or earlier. I've found it runs under ViewMAX/1, and I added an image file to
the Output list, and viewed that. I then tried to load a list and view
those, and it crashed. You can run Output on ViewMAX/2, but it crashes
with the Item Selector and trying to view files. It works with GEM/4, but
cannot view the special Artline GEM files viewable by Output 4.0.
It doesn't seem to work under GEM/5 (although my copy of GEM/5 seems to
have stopped running anything). It does not run under GEM/XM.

INSTALLATION
============

To install Output, copy the OUTPUT.APP and OUTPUT.RSC files to your GEMAPPS
directory.

BUILDING OUTPUT
===============

To build Output, ensure that you have the build tools available from
http://www.deltasoft.com/downloads.htm installed, and run the BUILD.BAT file
in the SOURCE directory. If all is well, it should build.

NEW IN THIS RELEASE
===================

- Added support for help in settings dialogs
- Checked GEM version number at startup and quit if running under GEM/1 or 2
- Made message that appears when OUTPUT.RSC not found more friendly
- Started adding support for extended File Selector, but gave up (delayed?)
  when bindings were out-of-date and I needed to add the necessary calls
  myself :)

KNOWN BUGS IN THIS RELEASE
==========================

- None, although there probably are some
