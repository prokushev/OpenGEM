Choose this entry if you have an HPGL compatible plotter.  Manufacturers 
like Hewlett Packard, Bruning, Calcomp, Roland DG, and Epson have models 
that use the Hewlett Packard Packard Graphics Language (HPGL).  HPGL 
support is sometimes optional on non-HP plotters.  Check with the plotter
manufacturer if you have questions regarding HPGL support by your 
particular plotter.

The plotter hardware should be set up for 9600 baud, 8 data bits, 1 stop
bit, and no parity.  Check your plotter documentation to see how this
should be done.
