			    README.DOC File
			       March 1988

This file is divided into the following sections:

1.  Hewlett Packard HPGL (and Compatibles) Plotter Configuration File
2.  Houston Instruments DM/PL Plotter Configuration File
______________________________________________________________________

SECTION 1. USING THE HEWLETT PACKARD HPGL (AND COMPATIBLES) PLOTTER 
           CONFIGURATION FILE

* The HPGL Driver supports a configuration file to allow proper
  operation when the driver cannot communicate with the plotter 
  directly. It may also be used to customize the plotter's 
  performance with certain pen and media combinations.

* The configuration file MUST be named VDHPX.CNF and reside in the
  \GEMAPPS\GEMSYS directory.

* The configuration file will usually be used to slow the plotter
  down when making transparencies. For this purpose, the velocity 
  command (see below) is provided. Follow the manufacturer's 
  recommendation for the pens and media you will use.

* The plotter should be set up for 9600 baud, 8 data bits, 1 stop bit,
  and no parity. Refer to the plotter documentation to see how this 
  is done.

* There are plotters which do not support the HPGL "OI"command but which 
  allow the driver to identify the HP plotter model by other means. If 
  your plotter does not support the HPGL OI function, you may specify 
  in the configuration file the HP plotter model number that best 
  matches your plotter.

* When using OUTPUT.APP, changing the paper size has no effect until a
  new start command is given. Also, changing paper size in the middle of
  an output list is not recommended.

* Commands available for the configuration file.

	model(nnnn)   - This identifies the plotter model to the driver.
			THIS IS ALSO THE ONLY CONFIG FILE PARAMETER THAT
			TAKES PRECEDENCE OVER INFORMATION RETURNED FROM 
			THE PLOTTER. Using this parameter has the effect 
			of suppressing an identifier inquiry to the 
			plotter from the driver. This is done because 
			some plotters do not support the HPGL OI 
		        command. Acceptable model numbers are:

				7440	7470	7475	7550
				7570	7580	7585	7586

	numpens(n)    - Informs the driver of the number of pens to be 
			made available. The number of pens used is 
			determined by the model number specified. The 
			default is 8.

	penwidth(x)   - Specifies pen width in tenths of a millimeter.
			The default is 0.3mm. 

	velocity(v)   - Specifies pen velocity in centimeters/second.
			The default is dependent on the model of the 
			plotter.

	roman()	      - No parameters. Its presence in the configuration 
			file tells the driver that the plotter supports 
			Hewlett Packard's roman (character set 7) 
			extensions set.

	init(". . .") - Specifies a string of HPGL commands to be sent 
			to the plotter after it has been initialized.  
			The double quotes are mandatory. In addition,  
			the string MUST NOT contain any double quotes.  
			Control characters, however, are allowed.

       final(". . .") - This is similar to the init command, however, 
			it is sent to the plotter when the plotting 
			session is being terminated.

SECTION 2. USING THE HOUSTON INSTRUMENTS DM/PL PLOTTER 
           CONFIGURATION FILE

* The DM/PL Driver supports a configuration file to allow proper
  operation when the driver cannot communicate with the plotter 
  directly. It may also be used to customize the plotter's 
  performance with certain pen and media combinations.

* The configuration file MUST be named VDHIX.CNF and reside in the
  \GEMAPPS\GEMSYS directory.

* The configuration file will usually be used to slow the plotter
  down when making transparencies. For this purpose, the velocity 
  command is provided. Follow the manufacturer's recommendation for 
  the pens and media you will use.

* The plotter should be set up for 9600 baud, 8 data bits, 1 stop bit,
  and no parity. Refer to the plotter documentation to see how this 
  is done.

* When using this plotter with OUTPUT.APP, only one filename should 
  be entered in an output list at one time. Entering multiple files 
  will mean that the output for successive copies or files will not 
  be positioned correctly on the plotter paper.

* The following commands are available for the configuration file.

	model(nn)     - Identifies the plotter model to the driver.
			Acceptable values are 29, 41, 42, 51, 52, 61, 
			and 62.

	numpens(n)    - Informs the driver of the number of pens to 
			be made available to the application. The 
			default is 14.

	penwidth(x)   - Specifies pen width in tenths of a millimeter.
			The default is 0.3mm.

	velocity(v)   - Specifies pen velocity in centimeters/second.
			The default is dependent on the model of the 
			plotter.

	chart(x)      - Specifies the chart size.  Use "s" for small 
			and "l" for large chart format. 

	resolution(n) - Specifies the resolution for the plotter to use.
			Normally,  the default resolution is best.
			However, one can obtain some reduction in plot 
			file size by specifying a coarser resolution. 
			Use the following values for n to specify 
			resolution:

			     Value   Resolution(mm)
			
		          	1 =  .001
				2 =  .005
				3 = 0.1
				4 = 0.025

			The default is 0.025mm.

	init(". . .") - Specifies a string of DM/PL commands to be sent 
			to the plotter after it has been initialized.  
			The double quotes are mandatory. In addition,  
			the string MUST NOT contain any double quotes.  
			However, control characters are allowed.

       final(". . .") - This is similar to the init command. It is sent 
			to the plotter when the plotting session is 
			being terminated.
